<!-- Hey trooper! My name is Rafiki, and welcome to my website!  -->

<!-- I [build things](https://github.com/othorizedshogun). -->

Some days, I find myself navigating an endless brain maze, wading through
the vast corpus I've been exposed to throughout my life, striving to push out reified
expressions. On other occassions, I'm immersed in passionate conversations with friends. Then
there are days like today, where I'm here, conveying thougths as much as the pen will allow,
hoping you gain my insights, perhaps a universe more if your mind permits.

<!-- I started this site to tell the story of my tech journey. I believe in
**technology that is open, enabling, and life-giving**. I aspire to usher that
potential&mdash;even for just a tiny bit. But, there is still a long way to go,
and this site records my progress.  -->

<!-- Here, you'll find some of my **thoughts, works, and notes** on software
development, machine learning, and research. I hope you'll spend a nice time
here, so go grab yourself a coffee and feel free to look around!  -->

The path for the uninitiated lies [here](/start-here/)!

## Background

I'm handle all things data at [Credit Cliq](https://creditcliq.com). I handle analytics, research 
and development of models for the african credit finance space.

<!-- Previously, I've worked at:
* [Thinking Machines Data Science](https://thinkingmachin.es) (Manila): a data 
    science consultancy where I built multiple natural language processing products
    for large enterprises, including a search engine, an industry classifier, and a
    document processing system to name a few. -->

<!-- * [Preferred Networks](https://www.preferred-networks.jp/en/) (Tokyo): as an
    intern, where I implemented a training parallelization framework for
    [ChainerRL](https://github.com/chainer/chainerrl), an open-source
    reinforcement learning library. -->

<!-- I obtained my master's degree from [Waseda
University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en) and my bachelor's in Electronics
Engineering, minor in Philosophy from [Ateneo de Manila
University](https://www.ateneo.edu). My research interests include machine
learning systems design and natural language processing. 

Lastly, I'm well-involved in open-source and have authored [several
projects](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921) of my own.
[Pyswarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms) has been quite
successful; I've seen it being used in [quantum
physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07686),
[chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00307), and
[teaching](https://www.gousios.gr/courses/algo-ds/optimizations.html), amongst
[other
things](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=15267041073198929167).
I love indie games and [dabble in game
development](https://ljvmiranda921.itch.io) using [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/). -->
